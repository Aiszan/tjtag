### Use case: Erasing nvram on Linksys WAP54G with dd-wrt running

I had fucked up the dd-wrt installation, forgetting to set nvram version to three, that caused the reset button not to work. That combined to bad configuration on WAP port i had the box unreachable. The only way to reset the box to factory defaults was to use jtag connection.

* Arduino: duemilanove/atmega 328  - worked out of the box, except that i had to retry the launch few times before "reseting arduino" went ok.
* OS: Ubunutu 14.04.3 / 3.15.0-031500rc2
* Target: WAP54G 3.1, running dd-wrt v24 - image on dd-wrt wiki page is from older version, same pins worked though. 
* Command: ```./tjtag -erase:nvram /wiggler /noreset``` 
* Notes: It did not work without ``` /wiggle /noreset ```. Chip identification worked fine.
